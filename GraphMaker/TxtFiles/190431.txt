Brochure for Teachers

You inspire strong minds.
Help inspire strong bodies.

Weave physical activity into the life lessons you teach each day.

You win as a teacher — and kids win as your students because physical activity can:

Increase self-esteem and capacity for learning. 

Help kids handle stress. 

Build and maintain healthy bones, muscles and joints. 

Help control weight. 

Good for the heart, the head and the soul.

Create a classroom that moves.

Put a little active fun into your lesson plans. Try:

Math Have students practice their measurement skills by measuring the distance covered when jumping, leaping and hopping.

Science Encourage students to do reports on the benefits of physical activity.

Computer Lab Send students to Web sites that provide information, tools and games that encourage physical activity. Try: http://www.kidnetic.com* and http://www.verbnow.com*.

Language Arts Ask students to record in their journals the amount of time they spend watching TV and being physically active — and what activities they enjoyed most and why. Encourage students to brainstorm with their family and classmates ways to be more active.

Spelling Host a spelling bee with a physical activity theme.

Reading Ask the librarian to prepare a book display and list of books about various physical activities and sports.

Step into an active mindset.

Make learning fun by adding activity. Here’s how:

Add-A-Move Memory Game Play a memory game in which students memorize movements instead of words. Keep it going until the class can remember 10 different movements – all in the right order. Ask the students to act out the movements in the correct order.

Mathematical Jumping Jacks Call out a math problem. If the answer is less than 20, ask students to give their answer in jumping jacks.

Authentic Graphing Have students do different activities that require varying amounts of effort like standing still, walking and running in place. After two minutes of each activity, ask them to measure their heart rates by taking their pulses. Graph and discuss results. Brainstorm ways to increase heart rates throughout the day.

Fitness Breaks Take a two-minute fitness break between lessons. Ask students to lead the break with stretches. Or, play a popular dance song and let students dance.

Q&A Catch Play a game of catch where a student catches the ball, calls out the answer to a question asked by the teacher, and quickly tosses the ball to someone else for the next answer.

Add-verb Fun Ask students to act out verbs such as skip, hop and march. Ask students to modify the actions by stating adverbs like rapidly, powerfully and enthusiastically.

Stretch your active influence beyond the classroom walls.

Reward students for being active at recess. 

Request donations from parents of used sports equipment for use at recess. 

Encourage participation in school intramural programs and community teams. 

Ask students about their physical activities outside of school. 

Create a bulletin board where students and teachers can post pictures of themselves being active. 

Assign this important homework: "Make sure you play."
